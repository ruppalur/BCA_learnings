Create a video and provide awareness on how technology connects yet isolates us.

There are multiple phases of video,

- break it down into scenes

There are broadly 5 scenes planned

- Opening scene
- Reality scene
- Impact scene
- Advantages scene
- Closing scene

### Low level details

#### Section - Opening Scene

#### Scene - The Reality Scene

Visuals:

- Family at dinner, all on phones

---

#### Scene - Impact Scene

Visuals:

- Clock showing time passing

Script:
`"The average person spends 7 hours daily on screens. That's 114 days a year. Half our waking life in a digital world.`

#### Scene - Advantages Scene

Visuals:

- Positive tech use: Video call with distant family
- Creating art with digital tools
- Using GPS for adventure

Script:
`Technology isn't the enemy. It's a tool. It can bring distant loved ones closer. It can amplify our creativity. The key is intentionality.`

#### Scene - CLOSING Scene

Visuals:

- Engaging with real world

Script:
`In this technical world, the most human thing we can do is choose when to disconnect. To look up. To be present. Because life isn't meant to be scrolled through—it's meant to be lived.`
